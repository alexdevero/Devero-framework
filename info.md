**Organization or website name** 

**Description of the website and its target audience**
Company: Come On Up is a shared accommodation housing company that embodies the concept of 'Wa'. The English translation of Wa can mean to live in harmony, and to have unity and conformity within a social group.

Our target audience are men and women, both Japanese and foreigners between the ages of 20 and 35, who are interested in living within a diverse community of people where they can share experiences and learn from each other. These people enjoy relating to one another themselves by sharing experiences and learning from others / someone who is interested in not only Japanese culture, but in other cultures as well.
